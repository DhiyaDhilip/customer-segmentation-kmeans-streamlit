# customer-segmentation-kmeans-streamlit
Customer segmentation project using K-Means clustering on supermarket sales data. Includes EDA, feature scaling, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score evaluation, and interactive visualization. Deployed as a Streamlit web application for real-time cluster analysis.

#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

##  Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation on supermarket sales data using unsupervised machine learning. K-Means clustering is applied to group customers based on purchasing behavior.

##  Objectives
- Identify distinct customer segments
- Understand purchasing patterns
- Visualize customer clusters for business insights

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit

##  Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Feature Scaling  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Optimal cluster selection using:
   - Elbow Method
   - Silhouette Score  
5. K-Means clustering  
6. Cluster visualization  
7. Streamlit deployment  

##  Key Insights
- Identified distinct customer groups based on spending behavior
- Cluster visualizations enabled targeted business strategies
